    instrument: "SpectraMax M5 Plate Reader",
    status: "failed",
    notes: `Conditions: HeLa cells, 10% FBS, 50uM Compound X, 72hr incubation.
Results: Cell viability 12% vs 85% control. Mass cell death observed.
Notes: Possible media contamination. pH looked off. Recommend checking media prep and compound stock concentration before next run.`,

    instrument: "SpectraMax M5 Plate Reader",
    status: "success",
    notes: `Conditions: HeLa cells, 10% FBS, 25uM Compound X, 48hr incubation. Fresh media batch.
Results: Cell viability 78% vs 85% control.
Notes: Reduced dose and time improved results significantly. Fresh media resolved contamination concern.`,

    assay_type: "ELISA",
    instrument: "BioTek Synergy H1",
    status: "failed",
    notes: `Conditions: IL-6 and TNF-a detection, patient serum samples, standard protocol.
Results: High background noise, inconsistent duplicates. OD values unreliable across all wells.
Notes: Suspect antibody degradation. Antibody stored at wrong temperature over weekend. CV exceeded 25% across duplicates.`,

    assay_type: "ELISA",
    instrument: "BioTek Synergy H1",
    status: "success",
    notes: `Conditions: IL-6 and TNF-a detection, fresh antibody lot, 4 degree storage confirmed throughout.
Results: Clean signal, CV below 10% across all duplicates. IL-6 range 12-340 pg/mL, TNF-a range 8-210 pg/mL.
Notes: New antibody lot resolved the inconsistency issue. Storage protocol updated for all future ELISA reagents.`,

    status: "in_progress",
    notes: `Conditions: HEK293T cells, Cas9 + sgRNA targeting TP53 exon 4, lipofection transfection.
Results: Western blot pending. PCR shows 60% indel frequency by T7E1 assay. Sanger sequencing confirms edits at target locus.
Notes: Awaiting protein-level confirmation by Western blot. Results look promising so far. Cell viability post-transfection was 85%.`,
