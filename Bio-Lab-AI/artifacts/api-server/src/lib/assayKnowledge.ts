export const QUANTIFICATION_PROTOCOL = `DATA QUANTIFICATION PROTOCOL — follow this on every plate before giving a verdict:
1. IDENTIFY the readout (absorbance/fluorescence/luminescence/OD/Ct) and the intent (concentration? potency? rate? growth? relative expression?) from the protocol/notes.
2. PICK THE METHOD:
   • Unknown concentration → fit a STANDARD CURVE (linear in-range, else 4PL/5PL or quadratic), report R², interpolate ONLY within range, apply dilution factor.
   • Compound potency → 4PL DOSE-RESPONSE on log(conc): report IC50/EC50 (units + 95% CI), Hill slope, plateaus, R²; flag if plateaus not captured.
   • Enzyme rate → INITIAL VELOCITY from the linear phase, then Michaelis-Menten Km/Vmax.
   • Binding → Kd from saturation (Y=Bmax·X/(Kd+X)) or kon/koff (Kd=koff/kon).
   • Growth over time → exponential-phase rate µ=ln(OD₂/OD₁)/Δt and doubling time ln2/µ.
   • Relative expression → ΔΔCt, fold change = 2^(−ΔΔCt).
3. COMPUTE ASSAY QC when controls exist: Z'-factor = 1 − 3(σp+σn)/|μp−μn| (≥0.5 excellent, 0–0.5 marginal, <0 fail); signal-to-background = μsig/μblank; signal-to-noise = (μp−μn)/√(σp²+σn²); %CV = 100·SD/mean per replicate group (<10–15% good).
4. CHECK PLATE HEALTH: edge effects (peripheral vs inner wells), outliers (>2–3 SD), row/column gradients, saturated or floored signal. Recommend a heatmap/scatter when spread is high.
5. REPORT hard numbers with units and specific well IDs; state assumptions (dose axis, which wells are controls); separate technical artifact from real biology; give a confidence level.
Never invent a standard curve, dose axis, or control set that isn't in the data — if it's missing, say what's needed.`;
